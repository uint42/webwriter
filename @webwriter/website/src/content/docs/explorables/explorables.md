# Explorables
WebWriter is built to edit explorables, which are...
- **open**, conformant with OER principles allowing easy reuse
- **multimodal**, combining many media types such as text, audio, video, etc.
- **interactive**, allowing users to interact and receive feedback
- **web based**, built with client-side web standards and deployable on the web
- **file oriented**, available as all-in-one, standalone, offline-capable files


## Technical View
At the core, explorables are HTML documents. Viewed as data structure, an explorable is a DOM tree that be displayed by browsers and serialized to or parsed from HTML.

## Author/User View
To authors, explorables are the main entity they are creating with WebWriter. To users, explorables (with embedded widgets) are the only part of WebWriter they experience at all.
